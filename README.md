# Mall_Customer_Segmentations_Project
# Overview
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. By clustering customers into different groups, businesses can better understand their customers, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer experience. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying various clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

# Introduction
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms
5. Results and Analysis
6. Conclusion

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation for a mall. Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand their customer base and to devise targeted marketing strategies. This project utilizes the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset, which contains information on customers' annual income, spending score, and other demographic details.

# 1. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customer Segmentation Data, which can be found on Kaggle. The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
2. Gender: Gender of the customer
3. Age: Age of the customer
4. Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousand dollars
5. Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature
6. 
# 2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

1. Handling missing values
2. Encoding categorical variables (Gender)
3. Scaling numerical features (Annual Income and Spending Score)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# 3. EDA involves:

1. Visualizing the distribution of various features
2. Analyzing the relationship between different features
3. Identifying patterns and insights in the data
4. Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms
The following clustering algorithms are applied for customer segmentation:

K-Means Clustering

For each algorithm, the following steps are performed:

Determining the optimal number of clusters
Fitting the model to the data
Visualizing the clusters
# Results and Analysis
The results section includes:

1. Visual representation of the clusters
2. Interpretation of each cluster
3. Comparison of the performance of different clustering algorithms
# Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the key findings from the customer segmentation analysis and discusses how these insights can be used to improve business strategies and customer engagement.
